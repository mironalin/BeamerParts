=== TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION ===

Core Technologies:
- Java 21, Spring Boot 3.5.4, Spring Cloud 2025.0.0
- PostgreSQL with Flyway migrations
- Redis for caching and performance
- RabbitMQ for event-driven architecture
- MapStruct for DTO mapping
- Spring Security for authentication
- Resilience4j for fault tolerance

Key Business Domain:
- Product catalog with BMW compatibility (âœ… M0 COMPLETE)
- Inventory management (âœ… M0 basic, ðŸ”„ M1 reservations)
- Category hierarchy with navigation (âœ… M0 COMPLETE)
- Advanced search and filtering capabilities (âœ… M0 COMPLETE)
- Event-driven cache invalidation (ðŸ”„ M2 TO IMPLEMENT)
- BMW data synchronization with vehicle-service (ðŸ”„ M1 TO IMPLEMENT)

=== TESTING EXCELLENCE (92.38% COVERAGE) ===

Reference Testing Patterns (Follow Exactly):

Domain Services (@SpringBootTest + @Transactional):
```java
@SpringBootTest
@Transactional
@ActiveProfiles("test")
class ProductCatalogDomainServiceTest {
    // âœ… Real repositories, mock external services only
    // âœ… Comprehensive business scenario testing
    // âœ… Dynamic test data with unique identifiers
    // âœ… Constraint validation testing
}
```

Controllers (@WebMvcTest + @Import for real mappers):
```java
@WebMvcTest(ProductController.class)
@Import({ProductMapper.class, CategoryMapper.class})
class ProductControllerTest {
    // âœ… Real mappers included via @Import
    // âœ… Mock domain services only
    // âœ… Complete API contract testing
}
```

Entities (@SpringBootTest for persistence):
```java
@SpringBootTest
@Transactional
@ActiveProfiles("test")
class ProductTest {
    // âœ… Full application context
    // âœ… Real database operations
    // âœ… Business method testing
    // âœ… Constraint validation
}
```

Coverage Standards (Reference Targets):
- Overall Service: 92.38% (achieved) - target 90%+
- Domain Services: 95%+ coverage (critical business logic)
- Entity Business Logic: 85%+ coverage
- Controllers: 80%+ coverage
- DTOs/Mappers: 85%+ coverage

=== INTEGRATION PATTERNS ===

Service-to-Service Communication:
- Internal APIs for basic operations (âœ… M0 COMPLETE)
- Real-time inventory coordination (ðŸ”„ M1 TO IMPLEMENT)
- BMW data synchronization (ðŸ”„ M1 TO IMPLEMENT)
- Event publishing for platform coordination (ðŸ”„ M1 TO IMPLEMENT)

Event Architecture (RabbitMQ) - M1 TO IMPLEMENT:
- ProductCreatedEvent, ProductUpdatedEvent
- InventoryLevelChangedEvent, LowStockAlertEvent
- BmwCompatibilityUpdatedEvent
- Consuming OrderCancelledEvent, CartAbandonedEvent

Caching Strategy (Redis) - M2 TO IMPLEMENT:
- Product catalog caching with intelligent TTL
- Real-time inventory data caching
- BMW compatibility result caching
- Search results caching with smart invalidation

=== YOUR SPECIFIC TASKS ===

Primary Responsibilities:
1. **M1 Implementation**: RabbitMQ events and BMW data synchronization
2. **M2 Implementation**: Redis caching and performance optimization
3. **Admin Enhancement**: Advanced analytics and reporting (basic admin APIs complete)
4. **Test Coverage Excellence**: Maintain 90%+ coverage for all new features
5. **Pattern Documentation**: Establish reference patterns for other services

When Making Changes:
- Follow strategic TDD approach: critical features get tests-first, standard features get tests-after
- Maintain or improve the 92.38% coverage standard for M0, target 90%+ for M1/M2/M3
- Test all changes comprehensively before implementation
- Document patterns for other services to follow
- Use existing helper methods and test factories from M0 implementation

Quality Standards:
- NEVER compromise on test coverage below 90%
- ALWAYS use proven testing patterns (reference implementation)
- ALWAYS validate business logic thoroughly
- NEVER introduce breaking changes to service contracts
- ALWAYS follow .cursorrules patterns

=== BUSINESS LOGIC PRIORITIES ===

M1 Critical Areas (Full TDD - Tests First):
- RabbitMQ event publishing and consumption
- BMW data synchronization with vehicle-service
- Real-time inventory coordination with order-service
- Event-driven cache invalidation
- Cross-service data consistency

M2 Performance Areas (Implementation First, Then Tests):
- Redis caching implementation
- Query performance optimization
- Connection pooling and database tuning
- Response time improvements

Admin Enhancement Areas (Implementation First, Then Tests):
- Advanced business analytics and reporting (basic admin CRUD âœ… complete)
- Bulk operations and data export functionality
- Admin dashboard with metrics and insights
- Advanced admin search and filtering capabilities

Key Files for Context:
- .cursorrules - Development standards and testing policies
- docs/tickets/product-service/BUSINESS-LOGIC.md - Domain knowledge
- docs/tickets/product-service/DEVELOPMENT-CONTEXT.md - Architecture overview
- beamerparts_api_contract.md - API specifications
- beamerparts_documentation.md - Platform overview

Testing Reference:
- product-service/src/test/java/ - 92.38% M0 coverage patterns
- Proven helper methods and test factories for M0
- Strategic TDD patterns to apply for M1 critical features
- Real component integration patterns established in M0

=== SUCCESS CRITERIA ===

Excellence Indicators:
âœ… M0: 92.38% test coverage achieved (COMPLETE)
âœ… Admin APIs: Basic CRUD operations complete (Product/Category/Inventory)
ðŸŽ¯ M1: Event architecture operational with 90%+ coverage
ðŸŽ¯ M2: Caching achieving <50ms response times with 90%+ coverage  
ðŸŽ¯ Admin Enhancement: Advanced analytics and reporting with 90%+ coverage
ðŸŽ¯ All patterns documented for other services to follow

Remember: You are building the REFERENCE IMPLEMENTATION. Every pattern you establish will be followed by user-service, vehicle-service, and order-service. 

NEXT STEPS: Start with M1 (RabbitMQ events and BMW sync) using strategic TDD for critical business logic, then proceed to M2 (caching) and admin enhancements. Follow the established M0 patterns and testing standards.
